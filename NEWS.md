3.37.1
======

## Highlights
  * `kubernetes` source: A new source for Kubernetes CRI (Container Runtime Interface) format.
     By default it tails the `/var/log/containers` folder which can be overriden with the `base-dir()` parameter.
     Example configuration:
     ```
     source {
       kubernetes();
       # or specifying the directory:
       # kubernetes(base-dir("/dir/to/tail"));
     };
     ```
    ([#4015](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/4015))
  * `mariadb-audit-parser`: A new parser for mariadb/mysql audit plugin logs have been added.
    The parser supports the `syslog` output type's format, see [mariadb page](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/mariadb-audit-plugin) for details.
    ([#3947](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3947))

## Features

  * `internal()`: add rcptid tag to all trace messages that relate to incoming
    log messages.  This makes it easier to correlate parsing, rewriting and
    routing actions with incoming log messages.
    ([#3972](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3972))
  * `syslog-parser()`: allow comma (e.g. ',') to separate the seconds and the fraction of a
    second part as some devices use that character. This change applies to both
    to `syslog-parser()` and the builtin syslog parsing functionality of network
    source drivers (e.g. `udp()`, `tcp()`, `network()` and `syslog()`).
    ([#3949](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3949))
  * `cisco-parser`: add ISO 8601 timestamp support
    ([#3934](https://github.com/syslog-ng/pull/3934))
  * `network()`, `syslog()` sources and destinations: added new TLS options `sigalgs()` and `client-sigalgs()`

    They can be used to restrict which signature/hash pairs can be used in digital signatures.
    It sets the "signature_algorithms" extension specified in RFC5246 and RFC8446.

    Example configuration:

    ```
    destination {
        network("test.host" port(4444) transport(tls)
            tls(
                pkcs12-file("/home/anno/Work/syslog-ng/tls/test.host.p12")
                peer-verify(yes)
                sigalgs("RSA-PSS+SHA256:ed25519")
            )
        );
    };
    ```
    ([#4000](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/4000))
  * `set-matches()` and `unset-matches()`: these new rewrite operations allow
    the setting of match variables ($1, $2, ...) in a single operation, based
    on a syslog-ng list expression.
    Example:
    ```
    # set $1, $2 and $3 respectively
    set-matches("foo,bar,baz");

    # likewise, but using a list function
    set-matches("$(explode ':' 'foo:bar:baz')");
    ```
    ([#3948](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3948))
  * `$*` macro: the $* macro in template expressions convert the match variables
    (e.g. $1, $2, ...) into a syslog-ng list that can be further manipulated
    using the list template functions, or turned into a list in type-aware
    destinations.
    ([#3948](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3948))
  * `set-tag()`: add support for using template expressions in `set-tag()` rewrite
    operations, which makes it possible to use tag names that include macro
    references.
    ([#3962](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3962))

## Bugfixes

  * `http()` and other threaded destinations: fix `$SEQNUM` processing so that
    only local messages get an associated `$SEQNUM`, just like normal
    `syslog()`-like destinations.  This avoids a [meta sequenceId="XXX"] SD-PARAM
    being added to `$SDATA` for non-local messages.
    ([#3928](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3928))
  * `grouping-by()`: fix `grouping-by()` use through parser references.
    Originally if a grouping-by() was part of a named parser statement and was
    referenced from multiple log statements, only the first `grouping-by()`
    instance behaved properly, 2nd and subsequent references were ignoring all
    configuration options and have reverted using defaults instead.
    ([#3957](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3957))
  * `db-parser()`: similarly to `grouping-by()`, `db-parser()` also had issues
    propagating some of its options to 2nd and subsequent references of a parser
    statement. This includes `drop-unmatched()`, `program-template()` and
    `template()` options.
    ([#3957](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3957))
  * `match(), subst() and regexp-parser()`: fixed storing of numbered
    (e.g.  $1,$2, $3 and so on) and named capture groups in regular expressions
    in case the input of the regexp is the same as one of the match variables being
    stored. In some cases the output of the regexp was clobbered and an invalid
    value stored.
    ([#3948](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3948))
  * fix `threaded(no)` related crash: if threaded mode is disabled for
    asynchronous sources and destinations (all syslog-like drivers such as
    tcp/udp/syslog/network qualify), a use-after-free condition can happen due
    to a reference counting bug in the non-threaded code path.  The
    `threaded(yes)` setting has been the default since 3.6.1 so if you are using
    a more recent version, you are most probably unaffected.  If you are using
    `threaded(no)` a use-after-free condition happens as the connection closes.
    The problem is more likely to surface on 32 bit platforms due to pointer
    sizes and struct layouts where this causes a NULL pointer dereference.
    ([#3997](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3997))
  * `set()`: make sure that template formatting options (such as `time-zone()` or
    `frac-digits()`) are propagated to all references of the rewrite rule
    containing a `set()`. Previously the `clone()` operation used to implement
    multiple references missed the template related options while cloning `set()`,
    causing template formatting options to be set differently, depending on
    where the `set()` was referenced from.
    ([#3962](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3962))
  * `csv-parser()`: fix `flags(strip-whitespace)` and `null-value` handling
    for greedy column
    ([#4028](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/4028))

## Other changes

  * `java()/python() destinations`: the `$SEQNUM` macro (and "seqnum" attribute in
    Python) was erroneously for both local and non-local logs, while it should
    have had a value only in case of local logs to match RFC5424 behavior
    (section 7.3.1).  This bug is now fixed, but that means that all non-local
    logs will have `$SEQNUM` set to zero from this version on, e.g.  the `$SEQNUM`
    macro would expand to an string, to match the syslog() driver behaviour.
    ([#3928](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3928))
  * `dbld`: add support for Fedora 35 in favour of Fedora 33
    ([#3933](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/3933))
  * debian: fix logrotate file not doing the file rotation. (The path and command was invalid.)
    ([#4031](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/4031))
  * OpenSSL: add support for OpenSSL 3.0
    ([#4012](https://github.com/syslog-ng/syslog-ng/pull/4012))
  * The MD4 hash function (`$(md4)`) is no longer available when compiling syslog-ng with OpenSSL v3.0.
    MD4 is now deprecated, it will be removed completely in future versions.
